Description:

I offer image and concept translation in the form of a black ink machine tattoo via my hand/eye/vibe. 

Themes include interdependence, weird nature, death/birth, psychedelia, extreme text, and visual puns. Flash is one of one and I prioritize drawn-on and/or freehand tattoos. 

If you are interested in traditional tattoos, color, realism, script, or replication of preexisting imagery please choose one of the many talented and professional tattooers trained in that practice. However, If your concept or desire resonates with my creative practice I would love to work with you.
